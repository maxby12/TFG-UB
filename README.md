# Abstract

The aim of this project is to achieve good image representations through the use of
Deep Learning technologies which are part of a broader family of Artificial Intelligence
methods named Machine Learning. These image representations are vectors of representative
float numbers called embeddings that, for the project, are focused on the entire
digestive aparatus for medical purposes. Triplet loss is used altogether with a state of the
art Convolutional Neural Network, ResNet, in order to achieve this goal. A series of tests
are done in order to compare different training approaches of the ResNet model, seeking
for the best image representations in the domain of the digestive aparatus. It is shown that
ImageNet transfer learning underperforms with respect to not applying transfer learning
for really specialized domains. To conclude, it is found that unsupervised representation
learning through the use of Triplet loss enables transfer learning for specialized image
domains such as the digestive aparatus.
